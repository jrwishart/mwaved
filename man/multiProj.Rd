\title{Meyer wavelet projection given a set of wavelet coefficients}
\usage{
multiProj(beta, j1 = log2(length(beta$coef)) - 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta}{A \code{waveletCoef} object that contains a vector of wavelet coefficients and the coarsest resolution level, \code{j0} to create the required output function expansion.}

\item{j1}{The finest resolution to be used in the projection (specifies which resolution that the wavelet expansion is truncated).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of size n giving the wavelet function expansion.
}
\description{
Reconstructs a function using wavelet coefficients (\code{waveletCoef} object) as input.
}
\details{
Function that takes an input of wavelet coefficients in the form of a \code{waveletCoef} object (see \code{\link{multiCoef}} for details) and optionally a desired maximum resolution level, \code{j1}, to create an inhomogeneous wavelet expansion starting from resolution \code{j0} up to resolution \code{j1}.
Namely, it creates the wavelet expansion, \deqn{\sum_{k = 0}^{2^{j_0} - 1} \beta_k \phi_{j_0,k} + \sum_{j = j_0}^{j_1} \sum_{k = 0}^{2^j - 1} \beta_{j,k} \psi_{j,k}.}
where \eqn{(\phi,\psi)} denote the father and mother periodised Meyer wavelet functions and \eqn{\beta_{j,k}} denotes the mother wavelet coefficient at resolution j and location k and \eqn{\beta_{k}} denotes the father wavelet coefficients at resolution \eqn{j=j0} and location \eqn{k}.
The coefficients \code{beta} need to be ordered so that the first \eqn{2^\code{j0}} elements correspond to father wavelet coefficients at resolution \eqn{j=\code{j0}} and the remaining elements correspond to the mother wavelet coefficients from resolution \eqn{j=\code{j0}} to \eqn{j = log_2 n - 1}. If the maximum resolution level \emph{j1} is not specified, the full wavelet expansion will be given.
