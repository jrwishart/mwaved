\item{m}{Number of channels}
}
\description{
Creates appropriately sized blur matrix for the special case when no blurring is apparent.
}
\details{
Function creates a matrix of dimension n by m which contains appropriate entries for the case when a direct multichannel signal is observed. That is, no blurring operator is apparent.
